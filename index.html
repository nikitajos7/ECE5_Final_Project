					<h2>Initial Robot Prototype Pictures</h2>

				<p>Parts: Arduino Mega 2560, chassis given by class, 2 motors, 2 wheels
					, jumper wires, breadboards, 7 photoresistors, 7 resistors, 4 potentiometers,
					motot shield, cardboard (for makeshift light shield and shelf), and lots of tape.
					<br /> Assembly: While building our prototype one of the biggest issues was finding 
					a place for all of the different components. This was especially hard since the chassis
					we designed wasn't ready yet, so we had to make the part we added to the chassis with tape.
					Another issue we came into was the jumper wires, as they went all of the place and sometimes
					dragged on the floor. The jumper wires to connect the photoresistors were the hardest to deal with
					because the breadboard for the photoresistors has to face down, so the wire would just stick out.
					We were able to fix this in the final robot by soldering the wires, so the wires could connect 
					from the top and the photoresistors from the bottom.

					<h2>PID Control</h2>
					<p>Our default PID values were:
						<br /> S = 8
						<br /> P = 30
						<br /> I = 0
						<br /> D = 18
						<br /> We chose these values because it allowed for the
						right amount of speed, our nominal speed was very high,
						while also allowing the robot to turn a little to ensure
						that it can notice changes in the track.
						<br /> These values changed
						with each track depending on how many twists and turns there
						were and how important speed was for the ranking. For example,
						our speed for the frequency sweep was set to alomst 0
						if not 0 because speed wasn't required for this track.
						We also increased P and D for this track because of the sharp
						turns it had to complete. This was also the case for the
						circuit loop since it also had sharp turns as well. On
						the other hand, for the drag race there were barely any twists
						and turns so our P and D values could be very close to 0
						and our speed was able to be maxed out to allow the robot
						to go faster.

					<h2>Improvements</h2>
					<p>Some improvements we could have made was having a better
						chassis that had more support for the shelf. A few days
						before the final competition the shelf part of our chassis
						snapped and even though we we able to put it back together
						with tape it still interfered with the wheels, causing the
						wheel to fall off at times. Another improvement that could
						have been made is have a better error calculating algorithm.
						Our robot was able to do well in the drag race, but when it came
						to making sharp turns the robot failed to calculate how much it should
						turn to continue to follow the line. This severely affected our performance
						in the frequency sweep and the circuit loop.</p>
